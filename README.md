I only used Bootstrap's grid system for one row, but I didn't think it was necessary anywhere else. I also added a little bit of my own css so I could use custom colors. One of the things I implemented for smaller screen sizes is a button with a collapsible navbar at the bottom of the screen which expands at the medium breakpoint. I also made sure it looked good on as many screen sizes as possible. The one thing that bugs me that I wasn't able to fix is the border to the right of the "duration" column. As far as I can tell, there isn't a way to use breakpoints on borders in Bootstrap without adding custom SCSS/media queries, which I didn't have time to get into, so the border looks a bit strange on smaller screens. Regardless, thanks for checking out my work!
